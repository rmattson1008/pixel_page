        <h3 style = "color:white">John Conway (who sadly passed away from covid in April of last year) came up
        with a seemingly simple game. The rules were: XXXX. People took this concept and ran with it, making
        amazing works of art and even a space invader esque game. Below you will see the game in the way that
        John Conway invisioned it.</h3>
